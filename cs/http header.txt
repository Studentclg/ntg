HTTP Header :-
	they are used to pass additional info b/w the clients and the server through the request and response header. 
Request header :-
	it contain more info about the resource to be fetched or about the client requesrting the resource.

Response header :-
	it hold additional info about the response like its location or about the server providing it.

Representation header :-
	it contain info about the body of the resource or encoding / compression applied.

Payload header:-
	it contain representation independent info about payload data including content length and the encoding used for transport.

HTTP header injection :-
	it is a technique that can be used to facilitate malicious attacks such as cross-site scripting,web cache poisoning and more.


--> causes

-> most web appliaction security vulnerabilites , HTTP header injection vulnerablities (and CRLF [carriage return and line feed] vulnerablities in general) 
are the result of overtrusting user input. if the developer of a web applicaton uses external data directly in HTTP responses , it's usually possible to perform 
an HTTP header injection attack.

--> Stored HTTP header injection 
	the related attacks are quite rare ,just like in the case of stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilites stored HTTP header injection is more dangerous becz
it may potentially affect all users that vist your website or use ur web application.

--> Consequences of HTTP header injection attacks
	the attacker may exploit an HTTP header injection vulnerability directly to use your domain as a basis for a phishing attack.

--> how to detect and avoid HTTP 
	the best way to detect HTTP header injection vulnerablities is to use a renownde web vulnerability scanner such as Acunetix
